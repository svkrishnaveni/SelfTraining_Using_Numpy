Requirements and dependencies:
    1. Numpy

Loading train and test data:

I have copied the data from web generated php files into text file (data_2c2d3c3d_program.txt)
I use custom functions (Load_data) to load and convert .txt files to numpy arrays
Please place input .txt files (data_2c2d3c3d_program.txt)  in the current working directory



Inorder to use custom data, copy the data to a text file and use Load_data* functions with appropriate paths to .txt files.

All supporting functions are mainly located in utilities.py
